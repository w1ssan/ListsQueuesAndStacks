/**
 * (Animation: doubly linked list) Write a program to animate search, insertion,
 * and deletion in a doubly linked list, as shown in Figure 24.24. The Search button
 * searches the specified value in the list. The Delete button deletes the specified
 * value from the list. The Insert button appends the value into the list if the index
 * is not specified; otherwise, it inserts the value into the specified index in the list.
 * Also add two buttons named Forward Traversal and Backward
 * Traversal for displaying the elements in a forward and backward order, respectively, using
 * iterators, as shown in Figure 24.24. The elements are displayed in a label.
