/**
 * (Revise MyPriorityQueue) Listing 24.8 uses a heap to implement the priority
 * queue. Revise the implementation using a sorted array list to store the elements
 * and name the new class PriorityUsingSortedArrayList. The elements in
 * the array list are sorted in increasing order of their priority with the last element
 * having the highest priority. Write a test program that generates 5 million integers
 * and enqueues them to the priority and dequeues from the queue. Use the same
 * numbers for MyPriorityQueue and PriorityUsingSortedArrayList and
 * display their execution times.
